## Span Tech Style Guide
A project for Code Louisville Frontend Web Development course

### Description
In a web project, a designer hands off to a developer static mockups and style guide of how the website should look like. However, mockups and style guide sometimes leave a lot of room for guessing and mind reading. Also, over time, changes and updates are made, but they are not reflected in the mockups. To prevent that from happening, I built an HTML & CSS style guide. This living style guide will be easy to understand, to update changes and to be reused for future projects.
